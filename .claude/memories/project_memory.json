User prefers validation/testing before new features. No agent swarms for sequential dependent tasks. Be extremely clear about what actions user needs to take; state clearly if no action needed. User prefers directness over hedging. Dashboard purpose: comprehensive deal intelligence platform tracking ALL deals pursued (not just owned). Two currently owned deals: Cabana on 99th (Glendale, AZ) and Tempe Metro (Tempe, AZ). '4) Closed Deals' = currently owned, '5) Realized Deals' = sold/disposed. Do NOT expand extraction filter to older UW Model versions — different layouts would produce errors. Future task: group models by version for separate extraction.",

Phase 2 (API transformation): _to_frontend_property() converts flat DB rows to nested Property TypeScript interface. New endpoints: GET /properties/dashboard (nested list), GET /properties/dashboard/{id} (nested single), GET /properties/summary (portfolio stats). Frontend API client updated to use /properties/dashboard. Phase 3 (email fix): brcapital.com→bandrcapital.com across 16 files (backend source, config, tests, frontend, docs). Phase 4 (DB model): Added latitude, longitude, building_type, financial_data columns to Property model + alembic migration 8e6fdd43a452. TypeScript clean, Vite build succeeds.
