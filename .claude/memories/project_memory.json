User prefers validation/testing before new features. No agent swarms for sequential dependent tasks. Be extremely clear about what actions user needs to take; state clearly if no action needed. User prefers directness over hedging. Dashboard purpose: comprehensive deal intelligence platform tracking ALL deals pursued (not just owned). Two currently owned deals: Cabana on 99th (Glendale, AZ) and Tempe Metro (Tempe, AZ). '4) Closed Deals' = currently owned, '5) Realized Deals' = sold/disposed. Do NOT expand extraction filter to older UW Model versions — different layouts would produce errors. Future task: group models by version for separate extraction. Kill port: use 'fuser -k 8000/tcp' (lsof -t may not work on this system). User is adamant: NO mock data, NO fake data, NO silent fallbacks anywhere. Remove all fabricated trend data (sine waves, etc.). Per-page review workflow: fix issues, then 3-4 parallel agents (visual validation, data integrity, TypeScript/lint, test coverage).",

Market DB: PostgreSQL localhost:5432/dashboard_market_data (same server, separate DB). Cell reference file: Underwriting_Dashboard_Cell_References.xlsx in project root. VITE_API_URL fix: src/lib/config.ts always appends /api/v1 to base URL; api.ts imports API_URL from config.ts as single source of truth. Email domain: bandrcapital.com (NOT brcapital.com). CI requires: ruff check + ruff format on backend, tsc -b + vite build on frontend. Stale .pyc files can prevent --reload from picking up changes — delete __pycache__ when routes aren't matching. Redis warning (token blacklist) is harmless — falls back to in-memory store for dev.",
