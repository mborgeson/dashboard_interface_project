Revenue/loss section: Loss to Lease, Vacancy Loss, Bad Debts, Concessions, Other Loss. Other Income breakdown: Laundry, Parking, Pet, Storage, Utility, Other Misc. Effective Gross Income subtotal. Improved pie chart: donut style with Legend, paddingAngle, white stroke, shadow tooltip. CashflowRow skips all-zero rows. Expense total calculated from individual line items.\n\n[Task 14] Performance metrics fixed: Backend fallback logic (leveredIrr = ret.leveredIrr or ret.lpIrr) now working after re-seed. API returns leveredIrr=0.1704, leveredMoic=1.8029, totalBasisPerUnitExit=24.0, seniorLoanBasisPerUnitExit=12.0. unleveredIrr/Moic remain null (no extraction data).\n\n[Task 15] Standalone Transactions page removed: Deleted /transactions route from router.tsx, routes.ts, Sidebar.tsx, GlobalSearch.tsx. Property-detail TransactionsTab remains.\n\n[Task 16] Deals Timeline cards updated with 9 new metrics: Unit Count, Avg Unit SF, Current Owner, Last Sale $/Unit, Last Sale Date, T12 Return-on-Cost, Levered IRR, Levered MOIC, Total Equity Commitment, Deal Value. Backend enrichment: _enrich_deals_with_extraction() in deals.py queries extracted_values + property financial_data. New fields on DealResponse schema. Both /deals/ and /deals/kanban endpoints enriched. 25/30 deals have extraction data.\n\n[Task 17] Deal stages changed from 7 old stages (lead/underwriting/loi/due_diligence/closing/closed_won/closed_lost) to 6 SharePoint stages: dead, initial_review, active_review, under_contract, closed, realized. Labels: Dead Deals, Initial UW and Review, Active UW and Review, Deals Under Contract, Closed Deals, Realized Deals. Updated: deal.ts types/labels/colors, api.ts DealStageApi, useDeals.ts mapBackendStage, DealFilters, DealPipeline, KanbanBoard, KanbanBoardWidget, KanbanColumn, DealCard, DealDetailModal. Removed all 'Closed Lost' sections. Fixed metric cards to compute from filteredDeals (not unfiltered).",
