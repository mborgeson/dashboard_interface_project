# Implementation Plan - Antigravity Backup Workflow

The goal is to create a workflow that automatically (via user trigger or potential future automation) copies Antigravity conversation and artifact data from the Windows user profile to the WSL project directory.

## User Review Required
- [ ] Confirmed source paths: `conversations` and `brain` directories in `C:\Users\MattBorgeson\.gemini\antigravity`.
- [ ] Confirmed destination path: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\mattb\projects\dashboard_interface_project\antigravity`.

## Proposed Changes

### New Workflow
#### [NEW] .agent/workflows/backup-chats.md
- **Description**: A workflow to backup conversation and artifact data.
- **Steps**:
    1.  Ensure destination directory exists.
    2.  Use `robocopy` to mirror `conversations` and `brain` directories from source to destination.
    3.  Handle potential file access issues (though robocopy has retry logic).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  Run the workflow command `/backup-chats` (once created).
2.  Verify that files appear in `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\mattb\projects\dashboard_interface_project\antigravity`.
3.  Check content of a simplified file to ensure integrity.
