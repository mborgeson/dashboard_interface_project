# Walkthrough - Antigravity Backup Workflow

I have set up a workflow to backup your Antigravity conversations and artifacts to your project directory.

## What has been done
1.  Created a new workflow file: [.agent/workflows/backup-chats.md](file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/mattb/projects/dashboard_interface_project/.agent/workflows/backup-chats.md).
2.  Verified the backup process by running the `robocopy` commands to seed the destination directory.

## How to use
You can run the backup manually at any time by triggering the workflow (if available in your interface) or by running the commands documented in the workflow file.

The backup copies:
-   `conversations`: Your chat history.
-   `brain`: Your artifacts (like this one).

## Verification Results
-   Destination directory created: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\mattb\projects\dashboard_interface_project\antigravity`.
-   Files copied successfully using `robocopy` mirror mode.
