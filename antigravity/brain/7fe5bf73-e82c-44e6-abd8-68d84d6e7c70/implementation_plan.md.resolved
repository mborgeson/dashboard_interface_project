# Implementation Plan - Antigravity Backup Workflow

The goal is to create a workflow that automatically copies specific Antigravity conversation and artifact data to the WSL project directory.

## User Review Required
- [ ] **Limitation**: Automatic filtering by project is not possible due to binary file format opacity.
- [ ] **Solution**: Use a configuration file (`backup_list.txt`) in the project directory to explicitly list Conversation IDs to backup.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration
#### [NEW] .agent/backup_list.txt
- A text file containing a list of Conversation IDs (one per line) to be backed up.
- Initially populated with the current conversation ID: `7fe5bf73-e82c-44e6-abd8-68d84d6e7c70`.

### Workflow
#### [MODIFY] .agent/workflows/backup-chats.md
- **Logic**:
    1.  Read `.agent/backup_list.txt`.
    2.  Loop through each ID.
    3.  Copy `conversations/<ID>.pb` to destination.
    4.  Copy `brain/<ID>/` directory to destination.

## Verification Plan
1.  Create `backup_list.txt` with current ID.
2.  Run modified workflow.
3.  Verify only the specified ID is copied.
